# UCI Machine Learning - 6 Classifiers on 5 Datasets

## Project Overview

This project applies **6 classification algorithms** to **5 UCI Machine Learning datasets**, with all problems standardized to **binary classification**.

### 6 Classifiers Applied:
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
5. Decision Tree
6. Naive Bayes

### 5 Datasets Analyzed:
1. Census Income - Predict income >$50K
2. Chronic Kidney Disease - Predict CKD presence
3. Energy Efficiency - Predict high/low heating load (bucketed)
4. Thyroid Disease - Predict normal vs abnormal (bucketed)
5. Wholesale Customers - Predict high/low spender (bucketed)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Run all 5 notebooks in Jupyter
### Step 2: Generate presentation & report

```bash
python generate_docs.py
```

## Outputs

- outputs/UCI_ML_Analysis_Presentation.pptx
- outputs/UCI_ML_Analysis_Report.pdf
- outputs/figures/ (all plots)
